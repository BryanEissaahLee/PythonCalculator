This is a rought draft for a simple calculator written in Python, for use in Windows based operating systems. 
The script makes use of the Tkinter and os imports to provide a simple calculator plus extra secret features. 

The features are not harmful, but many do contain cmdlets which will be sent to your Terminal, including a write operation
which creates a .txt file added to the desktop. 

Current codes implemented include:
6969 - Finds the file path for the host desktop & creates a harmless .txt file labelled "viruspackage" with some added text, for spooking users. 
80085 - Sends a cmdlet to have the host "speak" a message back to the user. 
420 - Sends a cmdlet to have the host "speak" a message back to the user.
